# Disperse Prototype

Disperse is a real-time audio effect which features organic randomized 
delays. The idea is to to have a sound somehwere inbetween a reverb and a 
delay -- the bloom of a reverb and the rhythm of a tape delay. 
Ideal for guitar / plucky instruments.

Currently, I am re-writing this code from scratch to work in a VST format
as well as guitar pedal format.

## Development TODOs
Needs
- Design and add custom UI elements
- Implement tape saturation
- Implement UI for ordering delays in different ways (parallel vs serial)
- Implement EQ controls on each repeat

Wants
- Implement other delay types - shimmer, reverbed delays, compression on 
delays (clarity knob?)
